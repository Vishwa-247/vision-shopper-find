- **Smart ranking algorithms** for best deal identification

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Rationale

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Sidebar Layout**: Optimized for Chrome extension usage patterns - keeps tools accessible while maximizing result display space

2. **Client-side ML**: Uses TensorFlow.js for privacy and speed - no server round-trips for image analysis

3. **Modular Backend**: Service-oriented architecture allows easy addition of new e-commerce platforms

4. **Brave Search Integration**: Provides web-scale discovery beyond pre-configured platforms

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with mock data when services are unavailable

## üî¨ Machine Learning Models

### Primary Models
- **MobileNet v3 Small**: Lightweight CNN for mobile/browser deployment
  - Size: ~2.3MB compressed
  - Classes: 1000 ImageNet categories
  - Accuracy: 67.4% top-1 on ImageNet

### Color Analysis
- **Custom RGB clustering algorithm** for dominant color extraction
- **Perceptual color mapping** to standard color names
- **Color-aware search enhancement** for better product matching

## üöÄ Next Steps & Remaining Work

### High Priority (Required for MVP)
1. **Chrome Extension Manifest**: Create manifest.json and extension packaging
2. **Real API Integration**: Connect actual Brave Search API (requires API key)
3. **Content Script Implementation**: Enable real web scraping through content scripts
4. **CORS Handling**: Implement proper cross-origin request handling
5. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback

### Medium Priority (Enhancement)
1. **Authentication System**: User accounts and search history persistence
2. **Advanced ML Models**: Custom training for e-commerce specific classification
3. **Price Tracking**: Historical price data and alerts
4. **Browser Storage**: Local storage for offline capabilities
5. **Analytics Integration**: Usage tracking and performance metrics

### Low Priority (Future Features)
1. **Wishlist Functionality**: Save and track favorite products
2. **Social Sharing**: Share deals with friends
3. **Advanced Filters**: Price range, brand, rating filters
4. **Notification System**: Deal alerts and price drop notifications
5. **Multi-language Support**: Localization for different markets
